# TraceLens

TraceLens is a Python library focused on **automating analysis from trace files** and enabling rich performance insights. Designed with **simplicity and extensibility** in mind, this library provides tools to simplify the process of profiling and debugging complex distributed training and inference systems.

## Key Features

‚ú® **Hierarchical Performance Breakdowns**: Pinpoint bottlenecks with a top-down view, moving from the overall GPU timeline (idle/busy) to operator categories (e.g., convolutions), individual operators, and right down to unique argument shapes.

‚öôÔ∏è **Compute & Roofline Modeling**: Automatically translate raw timings into efficiency metrics like **TFLOP/s** and **TB/s** for popular operations. Determine if an op is compute- or memory-bound and see how effectively your code is using the hardware.

üîó **Multi-GPU Communication Analysis**: Accurately diagnose scaling issues by dissecting collective operations. TraceLens separates pure communication time from synchronization skew and calculates effective bandwidth on your real workload, not a synthetic benchmark.

üîÑ **Trace Comparison**: Quantify the impact of your changes with powerful trace diffing. By analyzing performance at the CPU dispatch level, TraceLens enables meaningful side-by-side comparisons across different hardware and software versions.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Event Replay**: Isolate any operation for focused debugging. TraceLens generates minimal, self-contained replay scripts directly from trace metadata, making it simple to share IP-safe test cases with kernel developers.

üîß **Extensible SDK**: Get started instantly with ready-to-use scripts, then build your own custom workflows using a flexible and hackable Python API.

## Quick Start

### Installation

**1. Install TraceLens directly from GitHub:**

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/AMD-AGI/TraceLens.git
```

**2. Command Line Scripts for popular analyses**

- **Generate Excel Reports from Traces** Detailed docs [here](docs/generate_perf_report.md)
(you can use compressed traces too such as .zip and .gz)

```bash
TraceLens_generate_perf_report_pytorch --profile_json_path path/to/your/trace.json
```

- **Compare Traces** Detailed docs [here](docs/compare_perf_reports_pytorch.md)

```bash
TraceLens_compare_perf_reports_pytorch \
    baseline.xlsx \
    candidate.xlsx \
    --names baseline candidate \
    --sheets all \
    -o comparison.xlsx
```

- **Generate Collective Performance Report** Detailed docs [here](docs/generate_multi_rank_collective_report_pytorch.md)

```bash
TraceLens_generate_multi_rank_collective_report_pytorch \
    --trace_dir /path/to/traces \
    --world_size 8 \
```

Refer to the individual module docs in the docs/ directory and the example notebooks under examples/ for further guidance.

**üì¶ Custom Workflows**: Check out [examples/custom_workflows/](examples/custom_workflows/) for community-contributed utilities including **roofline_analyzer** and **traceMap** ‚Äî powerful tools we're working on integrating more tightly into the core library.
