    "## Using Trace Diff to find the differences between two Pytorch Kineto Traces\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a step-by-step guide for comparing two PyTorch Kineto traces using TraceLens's TraceDiff tool. You will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load and parse trace files into event trees\n",
    "- Identify differences and points of difference (PODs) between traces\n",
    "- Merge the event trees and generate detailed and summary reports\n",
    "- Use the UID mapping feature to cross-reference events between traces\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Two Kineto trace files (JSON format)\n",
    "- TraceLens installed and available in your Python environment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs:**\n",
    "- Merged tree visualization\n",
    "- CSV files with kernel and op statistics\n",
    "- UID mapping for cross-referencing events\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:** You can customize output folder paths and use the UID map to link events between traces for deeper analysis.\n"
