# NCCL Analyser

In distributed deep learning, analyzing the performance of collective communication operations is crucial for diagnosing and optimizing **perfromance as we scale**. NCCL Analyser is a Python SDK designed to parse and analyze NCCL kernel events from trace files generated during distributed training or inference. By computing key metrics like **communication latency, message sizes, algorithm bandwidth, and bus bandwidth**, NCCL Analyser helps you gain insights into the communication patterns and potential bottlenecks in your distributed setups.

## Key Features

- **Detailed NCCL Event Analysis**: Extracts NCCL kernel events from trace files across multiple ranks. Computes communication latency for all-to-all events by taking the **minimum duration across ranks to eliminate waiting time**. Using this communication latency and message size, the tool computes algorithm bandwidth. Additionally, it calculates bus bandwidth based on the collective operation.

- **Summary Statistics**: Aggregates per-event data into summarized statistics grouped by **message size**, **dtype** and **collective operation**. These include summary metrics such as total latency, mean/min/max for communication duration, algorithm bandwidth, and bus bandwidth. 

- **Customizable File Mapping**: Offers flexible rank-to-file mapping to match your directory structure and naming conventions, making integration seamless.

- **PyTorch Support**: Currently built for PyTorch trace files, with the potential to extend support to other frameworks.

- **Lightweight and Simple**: Minimal dependencies and a straightforward codebase ensure the tool is easy to use and extend.

### Example Database

The NCCL Analyser can generate two types of databases: **detailed** and **summarized**.

1. **Detailed Database**: Contains records of each NCCL kernel event, including metadata and computed metrics such as communication latency, algorithm bandwidth, and bus bandwidth for every event across all ranks.

#### Example Detailed Database

| external_id | Collective name | In msg nelems | Out msg nelems | Group size | dtype | Process Group Name | comm latency (Âµs) | In msg size (MB) | algo bw (GB/s) | bus bw (GB/s) |

2. **Summarized Database**: Groups events by collective type, message size, and data type to compute aggregated metrics, including the mean values for communication latency, algorithm bandwidth, and bus bandwidth.

#### Example Summarized Database

```python
from nccl_analyser import NcclAnalyser
import os

# Initialize NCCL Analyser

output_db_path = os.path.join(profiles_root_dir, 'nccl_events_db.csv')
nccl_analyser.build_and_save_db(output_db_path)

# Build and save the summary database
summary_db_path = os.path.join(profiles_root_dir, 'nccl_summary_db.csv')
nccl_analyser.build_and_save_summary_db(summary_db_path)
```
