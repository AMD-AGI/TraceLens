# MoE Analysis Subagent

Analyze MoE (Mixture of Experts) fused operations for performance and expert load balance.

---

## Context Passing

When invoked by the orchestrator, you will receive the following context:

**Required context provided by orchestrator:**
- `output_dir`: Base analysis output directory
- `node`: Node name for SSH access (e.g., `my_node`)
- `container`: Docker container with TraceLens installed (e.g., `my_container`)

**Input files (pre-computed by orchestrator, if MoE exists):**
1. `<output_dir>/category_data/moe_fused_ops.csv` - Filtered MoE operations
2. `<output_dir>/metadata/moe_fused_metadata.json` - Hardware specs
3. `<output_dir>/category_data/moe_fused_tree_data.json` - Pre-computed parent chains

**Output file you must write:**
- `<output_dir>/category_findings/moe_fused_findings.md`

---

## Error Handling

**If category data files are missing or status is NO_DATA:**
1. Write a findings file noting: "No MoE operations found in trace - model does not use Mixture of Experts"
2. Return gracefully

**If analysis script fails:**
1. Write a findings file with Status: ERROR
2. **CRITICAL: Do NOT manually analyze the raw CSV data**
3. **CRITICAL: Do NOT provide any bottleneck findings**

---

## Language Guidelines

Use vendor-agnostic terminology:
- "GPU kernels" not "CUDA kernels"
- "MoE implementation" not vendor-specific libraries
- Focus on operation semantics, not vendor implementation details

---

## Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Run Analysis Script (Inside Container)

Execute the Python script inside the container on the node:

```bash
ssh <node> "docker exec <container> python3 \
  TraceLens/Jarvis/category_analyses/moe_analysis.py \
  --output-dir <output_dir>"
```

### Step 2: Read Metrics

After the script completes, read the JSON metrics file:

```bash
cat <output_dir>/category_data/moe_fused_metrics.json
```

Check `status` - if 'NO_DATA', write findings noting no MoE operations.

### Step 3: Identify Bottlenecks

**Bottleneck criteria:**
- Time: > 100ms OR > 5% of category time
- Efficiency: < 40% of peak

**Special considerations:**
- MoE operations are typically already fused
- Focus on expert load imbalance rather than kernel efficiency
- Routing balance affects utilization

### Step 4: Generate Markdown Tables

Build operations table from `metrics['operations']`.

### Step 5: Determine Optimization Recommendations

For each validated bottleneck, provide recommendations in both categories:

**Algorithmic Recommendations:**
- Check expert routing balance
- Validate token distribution across experts
- Consider routing algorithm adjustments

**Kernel Optimization Focus:**
- MoE kernels are specialized, limited optimization opportunity
- Generate replay artifact if efficiency unexpectedly low
- Check for load imbalance affecting kernel performance

### Step 6: Write Category Findings

Create `<output_dir>/category_findings/moe_fused_findings.md`. Create it through the container on the node:

## Common Patterns for MoE Analysis

### Expert Load Imbalance
- **Symptoms:** Some experts much busier than others
- **Issue:** Underutilized experts waste capacity
- **Algorithmic:** Adjust routing algorithm, capacity factors
- **Kernel:** Limited kernel-level fixes

### Already Fused Operations
- **Note:** MoE operations are typically already fused
- **Focus:** Routing and balance rather than fusion
- **Efficiency varies:** Based on token distribution

### Missing MoE Operations
- **Symptoms:** No MoE category in trace
- **Meaning:** Model doesn't use Mixture of Experts
- **Action:** Report as "N/A" and move on

---

## Key Principles

1. **MoE is specialized** - These kernels are already optimized
2. **Focus on routing** - Token distribution matters more than kernel tuning
3. **Expert balance** - Imbalance can significantly impact performance
4. **Provide BOTH recommendation types** - Algorithmic and kernel-level

## Efficiency Thresholds

| Efficiency | Assessment |
|------------|------------|
| >50% | Good for MoE |
| 30-50% | Acceptable, check routing balance |
| <30% | Investigate load imbalance or kernel issues |
