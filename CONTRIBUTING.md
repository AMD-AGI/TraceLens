# Contributing to TraceLens

Thanks for your interest in improving **TraceLens** — a toolkit that parses PyTorch/JAX profiler traces and generates useful insights.

This doc tells you how to set up a dev env, how we name branches and commits, how to test, and how to get your PRs merged fast.

---

## 📋 Before You Start

- Read the [README](./README.md) to understand scope and architecture.
- Search existing **issues** and **discussions** to avoid duplicates.
- For new features and enhancements (new analyser, backend integration, refactor), **open an issue** first to align on approach.
- Prefer small, modular, focused PRs.
- **Have a ready-made utility?** If your utility is already developed, you can raise a PR to add it directly to `examples/custom_workflows/`. This lets the community start using it right away while we plan a tighter integration into the core library.

# optional: virtual env
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# install (editable) + dev extras
pip install -U pip
pip install -e .
```
